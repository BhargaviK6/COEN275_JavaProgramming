ENVIRONMENT:Eclipse IDE for Java Developers

Version: Luna Service Release 2 (4.4.2)

INTRODUCTION:

The program has a few limitations. If the capacity of the array of objects store[] is exceeded, the program will throw an exception stating that there is an ArrayIndexOutofBounds Exception. Additionally while testing the usage scenarios, instead of calling the getContent() method from the tester() method, it is called directly from the getDoc(int id) and getDoc(int id, int key) method. It does the same exact function as indicated in the assignment example usage scenario.
