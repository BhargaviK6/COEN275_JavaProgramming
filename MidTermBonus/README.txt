INTRODUCTION:
This is a Java program which can read data from a text file and display a summary of data. The java program can parse each and every single line of the text file and ignore those lines which do not satisfy the requirements of the program. Lines which are considered valid are those which have exactly one string followed by one floating number. If the line does not satisfy these conditions, the program will choose to simply ignore that line. The program also has no restrictions on the number of lines or categories in the input text file and will parse it regardless.

The program will identify the distinct categories of the string type and sort the categories alphabetically. After this the total value as well as the average for each category will be displayed in the sorted order. The program can run against any text file which has the data in the correct format else the invalid lines will be ignored. 

Note: The text file which has been taken as input for testing purposes has been provided in the zip file. Please note that the program will take the entire path for the input file as an input to the program and this must be entered correctly in order to test the program.
